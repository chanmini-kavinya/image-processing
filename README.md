# Image Processing with Python

This repository demonstrates basic image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV, including intensity level reduction, spatial filtering, geometric transformations, and resolution reduction.

## Contents

1. **Intensity Level Reduction** - `intensity_reduction.py`
2. **Spatial Averaging (3x3, 10x10, 20x20)** - `spatial_averaging.py`
3. **Image Rotation (45°, 90°)** - `rotate_image.py`
4. **Block Averaging for Resolution Reduction** - `block_average.py`

## How to Run

Make sure to place an image named `image.png` in the working directory.

Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```
Run each script individually:
```bash
python intensity_reduction.py
python spatial_averaging.py
python rotate_image.py
python block_average.py
```
